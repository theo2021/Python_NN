# Python NN

A simple neural network library, writen in python for educational purposes. It provides a simple structure to promote researchers in developing their own layers and functions. Advanced tools such as Tensorflow and Pytorch deduce gradients automaticaly by following the the variable calculatons. On the contrary python_nn requieres for the user to derive the gradients. It also includes a framework to test the derivations. 

### Installation

Simple installation using pip:

```sh
$ pip install git+https://github.com/theo2021/Python_NN.git
```
### Examples

A simple jupyter example can be found [here](https://github.com/theo2021/Python_NN/blob/master/tests/python_nn%20simple%20example.ipynb)
There are plenty more options, more examples will be coming.
